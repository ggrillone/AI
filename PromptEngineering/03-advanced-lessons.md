# Part 3: Advanced Lessons

## Lesson 12: Meta Prompting & Workflow Design

### Objectives
- Understand meta prompting as a structural template for AI thinking
- Learn to design workflows that guide AI behavior
- Master the difference between meta prompting and Chain of Thought
- Create reusable workflow templates for complex tasks

### Explanation

#### What is Meta Prompting?

Meta prompting provides a **behavioral and structural template** that tells the model not just what to do, but **how to think and respond**. It's like giving the AI a process framework to follow.

**Key Difference:**
- **Chain of Thought**: "Think step-by-step" (encourages reasoning)
- **Meta Prompting**: "Review → Plan → Implement → Validate" (defines the thinking structure)

**Think of it as:**
- CoT = "Show your work"
- Meta prompting = "Here's the workflow process to follow"

#### Components of Meta Prompts

1. **Behavioral Template**: The overall approach
2. **Workflow Steps**: Specific phases with clear transitions
3. **Output Structure**: How to format responses at each phase
4. **Validation Points**: When to check work

#### Why Use Meta Prompting?

✅ **Benefits:**
- Consistent, predictable outputs
- Clear phase transitions
- Built-in quality checks
- Reusable across similar tasks
- Reduces need for iterative corrections

**Use Cases:**
- Complex refactoring projects
- Multi-phase implementations
- Systematic code reviews
- Architecture planning
- Documentation generation

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

**Creating a Meta Prompt Template**

**Step 1: Define the Workflow Phases**

For a refactoring task:
```markdown
Phase 1: Review - Understand current state
Phase 2: Analyze - Identify issues and opportunities
Phase 3: Plan - Create refactoring strategy
Phase 4: Implement - Execute the changes
Phase 5: Validate - Verify correctness
```

**Step 2: Specify Actions for Each Phase**

```markdown
Phase 1: Review
- Read through the entire component
- Identify all responsibilities
- Note dependencies and imports
- List current issues

Phase 2: Analyze
- Categorize issues by type (performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Assess risk level of changes
- Consider impact on dependent code

Phase 3: Plan
- Prioritize changes by impact and risk
- Define refactoring order
- Identify what stays the same
- Note potential gotchas

Phase 4: Implement
- Make changes incrementally
- Preserve functionality
- Add comments for complex changes
- Update related documentation

Phase 5: Validate
- Review against original requirements
- Check for introduced bugs
- Verify performance improvements
- Ensure no regressions
```

**Step 3: Add Transition Criteria**

```markdown
After each phase:
1. Summarize what was accomplished
2. List findings or changes
3. Confirm readiness for next phase
4. Ask for user validation if needed
```

**Step 4: Define Output Format**

```markdown
For each phase, output:
## Phase [N]: [Name]

### Findings
- [List of discoveries/issues]

### Actions Taken
- [What was done]

### Next Steps
- [What comes next]

### Questions/Blockers
- [Anything requiring clarification]
```

**Exercise 1: Create a Meta Prompt Template**

Create a meta prompting template for: **"Converting a class component to functional component with hooks"**

Your template should include:
- At least 3 phases
- Clear actions for each phase
- Output format specifications
- Validation steps

**Solution:**

```markdown
# Class to Functional Component Conversion Workflow

## Phase 1: Analysis
1. Identify all lifecycle methods used
2. List component state variables
3. Note prop usage and prop types
4. Identify instance methods and their usage
5. Check for refs and their purposes

Output format:
### Lifecycle Methods
- [Method name]: [Purpose]

### State
- [State variable]: [Type and initial value]

### Instance Methods
- [Method name]: [What it does]

### Refs
- [Ref name]: [Purpose]

## Phase 2: Mapping Strategy
1. Map lifecycle methods to hooks:
   - componentDidMount → useEffect with []
   - componentDidUpdate → useEffect with dependencies
   - componentWillUnmount → useEffect cleanup
2. Plan state migration:
   - Single state object → multiple useState or useReducer
3. Plan instance method conversion:
   - Methods → functions or useCallback
4. Plan ref conversion:
   - createRef → useRef

Output format:
### Hook Mappings
- [Lifecycle method] → [Hook approach]

### State Strategy
- [How to handle state conversion]

### Methods Strategy
- [How to convert instance methods]

## Phase 3: Implementation
1. Create functional component signature
2. Convert state to hooks
3. Convert lifecycle methods to useEffect
4. Convert instance methods
5. Convert refs
6. Preserve prop interface

Output:
- Converted component code
- Inline comments explaining complex conversions

## Phase 4: Validation
1. Verify all functionality preserved
2. Check dependency arrays in useEffect
3. Ensure no infinite render loops
4. Confirm prop interface unchanged
5. Check for memory leaks (cleanup functions)

Output:
### Validation Checklist
- ✓/✗ All functionality preserved
- ✓/✗ Dependencies correct
- ✓/✗ No render loops
- ✓/✗ Prop interface unchanged
- ✓/✗ Proper cleanup

### Potential Issues
- [List any concerns]

---

# Task
Convert this class component to functional:

[Class component code...]
```

**Validation:**
- **Self-Check**: Does your template guide the AI through a logical process?
- **Self-Check**: Are output formats specified for each phase?
- **Self-Check**: Does it include validation steps?

### Frontend Contextualization

**Real-World Scenario: Large Refactoring Project**

You have a 1000-line component that needs complete refactoring. A meta prompt ensures systematic, trackable progress.

**Without Meta Prompting:**
```markdown
Refactor this component to be more maintainable.
[Code...]
```

Result: Unpredictable changes, hard to track progress, might miss important considerations.

**With Meta Prompting:**
```markdown
# Large Component Refactoring Workflow

## Phase 1: Component Archaeology (15 min)
1. Document all current features and responsibilities
2. Map component dependencies (imports, context, props)
3. Identify all side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers)
4. List all event handlers
5. Document current state management

Save findings to: component-analysis.md

## Phase 2: Responsibility Analysis (10 min)
1. Group related functionality
2. Identify single-responsibility violations
3. Determine extraction opportunities:
   - Custom hooks
   - Child components
   - Utility functions
   - Context providers

Save to: refactor-opportunities.md

## Phase 3: Refactoring Strategy (15 min)
1. Prioritize extractions by risk (low risk first)
2. Define extraction order with dependencies
3. Identify what stays in main component
4. Plan state management changes
5. Note testing strategy for each change

Save to: refactor-plan.md

## Phase 4: Incremental Implementation (Iterative)
For each refactoring task from the plan:
1. Implement extraction
2. Preserve original functionality
3. Add tests
4. Validate in isolation
5. Document changes

After each task, confirm before proceeding to next.

## Phase 5: Integration & Cleanup (Final)
1. Remove dead code
2. Update imports
3. Add documentation
4. Final test pass
5. Update component documentation

## Phase 6: Performance Validation
1. Profile before/after
2. Check bundle size impact
3. Verify render performance
4. Measure load time

---

# Component to Refactor
[1000-line component code...]

Start with Phase 1 and save findings to component-analysis.md before proceeding.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear progress tracking
- ✅ Artifacts saved between sessions (markdown files)
- ✅ Pause points for review
- ✅ Risk mitigation through incremental approach
- ✅ Built-in validation at each phase

**Meta Prompting vs. Just Prompting:**

| Aspect | Regular Prompt | Meta Prompt |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Structure | Implicit | Explicit workflow |
| Consistency | Varies | Predictable |
| Progress tracking | Difficult | Clear phases |
| Reusability | One-off | Template for similar tasks |
| Quality control | Manual | Built-in validation |

**Practical Takeaway**: Meta prompting is your workflow engineering tool. Use it for complex, multi-step tasks where you want consistent process and clear progress. Create templates for repeated task types (code reviews, refactoring, feature implementation). Think of it as creating a "process framework" for the AI, similar to how your team might have code review checklists or deployment procedures. The upfront investment in creating a good meta prompt pays dividends in consistency and quality.

## Lesson 13: Prompt Chaining for Complex Tasks

### Objectives
- Understand prompt chaining as a method to solve complex problems
- Learn to break large tasks into connected subtasks
- Master the art of passing context between prompts
- Apply chaining techniques to multi-phase workflows

### Explanation

#### What is Prompt Chaining?

Prompt chaining involves **breaking a complex task into subtasks** where each prompt's output becomes input for the next prompt. It's like a pipeline where each stage refines and builds on previous work.

**Structure:**
```
Prompt 1 → Output 1 → Prompt 2 (uses Output 1) → Output 2 → Prompt 3 (uses Output 2) → Final Result
```

**Analogy**: Think of it like a relay race. Each runner (prompt) completes their leg and passes the baton (output) to the next runner.

#### Why Use Prompt Chaining?

✅ **Benefits:**
- **Manages complexity**: Break overwhelming tasks into manageable pieces
- **Focused expertise**: Each prompt can have a different role/focus
- **Context management**: Avoid context window limits
- **Iterative refinement**: Review and adjust between steps
- **Clear progress**: Track completion through chain stages
- **Error containment**: Issues in one step don't corrupt entire process

**Drawbacks:**
- Requires more user involvement
- Can be time-consuming
- Need to manage artifacts between steps

#### When to Use Prompt Chaining

**Good for:**
- Multi-step analysis (research → analyze → summarize)
- Complex features (design → implement → test → document)
- Large refactorings (analyze → plan → extract → integrate)
- Data pipelines (fetch → normalize → transform → render)
- Workflows with decision points

**Not needed for:**
- Single-step tasks
- Simple transformations
- Tasks that fit comfortably in one prompt

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

**Designing a Prompt Chain**

**Step 1: Identify the Overall Goal**

Example: "Create a new feature with comprehensive testing and documentation"

**Step 2: Break Into Logical Phases**

```markdown
Phase 1: Requirements gathering and analysis
Phase 2: Technical design
Phase 3: Implementation
Phase 4: Test creation
Phase 5: Documentation
```

**Step 3: Define Input/Output for Each Link**

```markdown
Prompt 1: Analyze requirements
  Input: Feature description
  Output: requirements-analysis.md (detailed requirements)

Prompt 2: Design technical solution
  Input: requirements-analysis.md
  Output: technical-design.md (architecture, components)

Prompt 3: Implement feature
  Input: technical-design.md
  Output: feature-code.ts (implementation)

Prompt 4: Create tests
  Input: technical-design.md + feature-code.ts
  Output: feature.test.ts (test suite)

Prompt 5: Write documentation
  Input: technical-design.md + feature-code.ts
  Output: feature-docs.md (usage guide)
```

**Step 4: Create Prompts with Explicit Handoffs**

Each prompt should:
- State what it receives from previous step
- Save its output to a file
- Indicate what the next step should consume

**Step 5: Execute Chain with Review Points**

After each step:
- Review the output
- Make adjustments if needed
- Proceed to next step

**Exercise 1: Design a Prompt Chain**

**Scenario**: You need to migrate a component from Redux to React Query for data fetching.

**Your Task**: Design a 4-step prompt chain.

**Solution:**

```markdown
# Migration Prompt Chain

## Prompt 1: Current State Analysis
Analyze the current Redux implementation.

[Component and Redux code...]

Output to redux-analysis.md:
1. What data is fetched
2. How it's stored in Redux
3. Which components consume it
4. All action creators and reducers involved
5. Side effects and middleware usage

## Prompt 2: React Query Design
Design the React Query replacement based on redux-analysis.md.

Output to react-query-design.md:
1. Query keys structure
2. Query functions to implement
3. Hook API design (useUserData, useProducts, etc.)
4. Caching strategy
5. Migration impact on components

## Prompt 3: Implementation
Implement the React Query hooks based on react-query-design.md.

Create:
1. Query hooks
2. Mutation hooks (if applicable)
3. Query client configuration
4. Type definitions

Output implementations and wait for review.

## Prompt 4: Component Migration
Update components to use React Query hooks instead of Redux.

Input:
- redux-analysis.md (list of components)
- React Query hook implementations

For each component:
1. Replace Redux connect/useSelector with React Query hooks
2. Remove Redux dependencies
3. Update loading/error handling
4. Preserve functionality

Show each component update separately.
```

**Validation:**
- **Self-Check**: Does each step have clear input from previous step?
- **Self-Check**: Are outputs saved to files for next step?
- **Self-Check**: Is there a logical progression?

### Frontend Contextualization

**Real-World Scenario: Building a Complex Feature**

**Scenario**: Add a collaborative commenting system to your document editor.

**Prompt Chain Design:**

**Chain Overview:**
```
1. Requirements → requirements.md
2. Data Model Design → data-model.md
3. API Contract → api-spec.md
4. UI Component Design → components.md
5. State Management → state-design.md
6. Implementation (Backend) → backend-code
7. Implementation (Frontend) → frontend-code
8. Real-time Integration → realtime-impl
9. Testing Strategy → test-plan.md
10. Implementation (Tests) → test-code
```

**Key Prompt Examples:**

**Prompt 1:**
```markdown
# Requirements Analysis

Analyze this feature request: "Add commenting to document editor"

Business goals:
- Users can leave comments on specific text selections
- Comments are threaded (replies)
- Real-time updates when others comment
- Comment notifications

Technical context:
- React frontend
- Node.js backend
- MongoDB database
- Socket.io for real-time
- 500+ concurrent users expected

Output to requirements.md:
1. User stories
2. Functional requirements
3. Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability)
4. Technical constraints
5. Success metrics
```

**Prompt 3 (uses requirements.md + data-model.md):**
```markdown
# API Contract Design

Based on requirements.md and data-model.md, design the REST API.

Output to api-spec.md:

For each endpoint:
- Method and path
- Request body schema
- Response schema
- Error responses
- Authentication requirements

Endpoints needed:
- Create comment
- Reply to comment
- Edit comment
- Delete comment
- Get comments for document
- Mark comment as resolved

Also design WebSocket events for real-time updates.
```

**Prompt 7 (uses api-spec.md + components.md + state-design.md):**
```markdown
# Frontend Implementation

Implement the commenting UI based on previous artifacts.

Context files:
- api-spec.md (API to call)
- components.md (component structure)
- state-design.md (state approach)

Implement in order:
1. API client functions
2. React Query hooks
3. Comment thread component
4. Comment composer component
5. Main comments panel

Show each implementation, wait for review before next.
```

**Benefits of Chaining This Feature:**
- ✅ Clear requirements before design
- ✅ Data model agreement before API
- ✅ API contract before implementation
- ✅ Frontend/backend can be parallel after API spec
- ✅ Testing informed by all previous decisions
- ✅ Artifacts serve as documentation

**Alternative Without Chaining:**
```markdown
❌ Build a commenting system for the document editor.
[One massive prompt with all requirements]
```

Problems:
- Overwhelming context
- Hard to review incrementally
- Easy to miss requirements
- Difficult to course-correct
- No documentation artifacts

**Practical Takeaway**: Prompt chaining is project management for AI collaboration. Break complex work into phases, create artifacts at each stage, and review before proceeding. This is especially valuable for features touching multiple parts of your stack (frontend, backend, database, real-time) or requiring multiple expertise areas (security, performance, accessibility). The artifacts you create (markdown files, code modules) serve double duty as both AI context and project documentation. Start seeing complex projects as chains, not monoliths.

## Lesson 14: Self-Consistency & Multi-Path Reasoning

### Objectives
- Understand self-consistency as a validation technique
- Learn to generate and compare multiple reasoning paths
- Master techniques for finding consensus answers
- Apply multi-path reasoning to critical decisions

### Explanation

#### What is Self-Consistency?

Self-consistency involves **prompting the model multiple times** with the same task but with variations (different models, temperature, or slight prompt differences), then comparing the reasoning paths and answers.

**Core Idea**: If multiple independent reasoning attempts reach the same conclusion, confidence in that answer increases.

**Formula:**
```
Same Task → Multiple Runs → Compare Reasoning Paths → Trust Consensus
```

**Think of it like:**
- Asking multiple experts the same question
- Checking if they agree on the answer
- If most agree, that answer is probably correct

#### Why Use Self-Consistency?

✅ **When it's valuable:**
- Critical decisions with one "correct" answer
- Complex problems with multiple solution approaches
- Security or performance-critical code
- Architecture decisions with significant impact
- Debugging complex issues

❌ **When it's not useful:**
- Exploratory tasks (you want multiple different answers)
- Creative work (diversity is good)
- Simple, straightforward tasks
- Tasks where correctness is easily verifiable

#### How It Works

**Step 1**: Run the same prompt multiple times with variations:
- Different temperature settings
- Slight prompt rephrasing
- Different models (GPT-4 vs Claude)
- Different examples (few-shot)

**Step 2**: Compare outputs:
- Do they reach the same conclusion?
- Is the reasoning path similar?
- Where do they differ?

**Step 3**: Trust the majority:
- If 4 out of 5 runs suggest Solution A, trust it
- If there's no consensus, investigate why

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

**Implementing Self-Consistency**

**Step 1: Create the Base Prompt**

```markdown
# Architecture Decision

Should we use Redux or Zustand for state management in our new dashboard?

Context:
- 15 components need shared state
- Real-time data updates
- Team familiar with hooks
- No existing Redux code

Think through:
1. Complexity vs. features
2. Learning curve
3. Bundle size
4. Developer experience
5. Community support

Provide a recommendation with reasoning.
```

**Step 2: Run Multiple Times with Variations**

**Run 1: Base prompt (as above)**

**Run 2: Add Chain of Thought**
```markdown
[Same context...]

Think step-by-step:
1. Analyze state management needs
2. Compare Redux and Zustand capabilities
3. Consider team familiarity
4. Evaluate trade-offs
5. Make recommendation

Provide detailed reasoning for your choice.
```

**Run 3: Different role**
```markdown
You are a senior architect who prioritizes developer experience and maintainability.

[Same context and question...]
```

**Run 4: Different temperature (if using API)**
```markdown
[Same prompt, but with temperature: 0.3 instead of default]
```

**Run 5: Opposite perspective**
```markdown
You are a performance engineer who prioritizes bundle size and runtime performance.

[Same context and question...]
```

**Step 3: Compare Results**

Create a comparison table:

| Run | Recommendation | Key Reasoning | Confidence |
|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Zustand | Simpler API, smaller bundle | High |
| 2 | Zustand | Less boilerplate, team uses hooks | High |
| 3 | Zustand | Better DX, easier to maintain | High |
| 4 | Zustand | Lighter weight | Medium |
| 5 | Redux | More mature, better dev tools | Medium |

**Step 4: Analyze Consensus**

- 4/5 recommend Zustand
- Common reasons: simpler, smaller, better for hooks
- Dissenting opinion focuses on maturity

**Step 5: Make Decision**

Strong consensus for Zustand. The dissent (Redux for maturity) is valid but outweighed by team context (hooks familiarity, no existing Redux).

**Decision**: Go with Zustand, acknowledge Redux as viable alternative.

### Examples & Exercises

**Example 1: Debugging with Self-Consistency**

**The Bug:**
```typescript
// Component sometimes shows stale data
function UserProfile({ userId }: Props) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, []);
  
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;
}
```

**Prompt (run 5 times with variations):**
```markdown
This component sometimes shows stale data when userId prop changes. 
What's the bug and how do I fix it?

[Component code above]
```

**Results:**

| Run | Identified Issue | Suggested Fix |
|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Missing userId in deps | Add `[userId]` to useEffect |
| 2 | Missing userId in deps | Add `[userId]` to useEffect |
| 3 | Missing userId dependency | Include userId in dependency array |
| 4 | Empty dependency array | useEffect should depend on userId |
| 5 | useEffect not rerunning | Add userId to dependencies |

**Consensus**: 5/5 identified the same issue (missing dependency). Strong confidence in the answer.

**Example 2: Performance Optimization Decision**

**Prompt:**
```markdown
This component re-renders excessively. What's the best optimization approach?

[Component code...]

Options:
A) React.memo
B) useMemo for computed values
C) useCallback for event handlers
D) Split into smaller components
E) Combination of above

Which should I implement first?
```

**Run this 5 times with slightly different framings:**
1. "Which single optimization would be most impactful?"
2. "Think step-by-step about the rendering issue and best fix"
3. "You are a performance expert. What's your recommendation?"
4. "Analyze the component and suggest the highest-impact optimization"
5. "What optimization gives best performance improvement for least complexity?"

**Results:**

| Run | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | useMemo + useCallback | Prevents prop changes causing child rerenders |
| 2 | Split components first | Isolates re-render to affected parts |
| 3 | React.memo on child components | Stops unnecessary propagation |
| 4 | useMemo for expensive computations | Biggest visible performance gain |
| 5 | Combination: memo + useMemo | Address multiple causes |

**Analysis:**
- No strong consensus (different aspects prioritized)
- This suggests multiple optimizations may be needed
- Different approaches valid for different scenarios

**Action**: Since no consensus, this indicates:
1. Problem is multi-faceted
2. Need to profile to identify actual bottleneck
3. Likely need combination approach

**Exercise 1: Apply Self-Consistency**

**Scenario:** Your team is deciding between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for a new product listing page.

**Your Task:**
1. Write a base prompt for this decision
2. Describe 3 variations you'd run
3. Create a comparison framework

**Solution:**

**Base Prompt:**
```markdown
# Rendering Strategy Decision

Should we use CSR or SSR for our product listing page?

Context:
- E-commerce site
- 10,000+ products
- SEO is important
- Page has filters and sorting
- Dynamic pricing
- Target: good Core Web Vitals

Consider:
- Performance
- SEO
- Development complexity
- Server costs
- User experience

Recommend CSR or SSR with reasoning.
```

**Variation 1: SEO-focused**
```markdown
You are an SEO specialist.

[Same context and question...]

Prioritize search engine discoverability and ranking.
```

**Variation 2: Performance-focused**
```markdown
You are a web performance engineer.

[Same context...]

Prioritize Core Web Vitals and user-perceived performance.
```

**Variation 3: Cost-focused**
```markdown
You are a technical architect managing infrastructure costs.

[Same context...]

Consider server costs, scalability, and resource efficiency.
```

**Comparison Framework:**

| Run | Recommendation | Primary Reason | Trade-off Noted |
|-----|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Base | [Record] | [Record] | [Record] |
| SEO | [Record] | [Record] | [Record] |
| Perf | [Record] | [Record] | [Record] |
| Cost | [Record] | [Record] | [Record] |

**Consensus Analysis:**
- If 3+/4 recommend same: Strong signal
- If split 2/2: Need more investigation
- Note: Different perspectives may value different trade-offs

**Validation:**
- **Self-Check**: Do your variations test different priorities?
- **Self-Check**: Is your comparison framework objective?

### Frontend Contextualization

**Real-World Scenario: Critical Architecture Decision**

Your team needs to choose a routing solution for a large React application.

**The Stakes:**
- Affects entire app structure
- Hard to change later
- Impacts bundle size, performance, DX

**Self-Consistency Approach:**

**Run 1: Base Analysis**
```markdown
Compare React Router v6 and TanStack Router for our application.

Context:
- Large app (100+ routes)
- Nested routing needed
- Type safety important
- Code splitting required
- SEO considerations

Recommend one with detailed reasoning.
```

**Run 2: Bundle Size Focus**
```markdown
You are a performance engineer focused on bundle size optimization.

[Same comparison...]

Prioritize minimal bundle impact and efficient code splitting.
```

**Run 3: Developer Experience Focus**
```markdown
You are a senior developer who values type safety and developer productivity.

[Same comparison...]

Prioritize DX, type safety, and maintainability.
```

**Run 4: Different Model**
```markdown
[Same base prompt, but use GPT-4 instead of Claude or vice versa]
```

**Run 5: Future-Proofing Focus**
```markdown
You are an architect planning for 3-5 year maintenance.

[Same comparison...]

Consider ecosystem maturity, community support, and longevity.
```

**Hypothetical Results:**

| Run | Choice | Key Reasons |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | React Router | Mature, large community, battle-tested |
| 2 | TanStack Router | Better tree-shaking, smaller bundle |
| 3 | TanStack Router | Superior TypeScript support |
| 4 | React Router | More examples, easier hiring |
| 5 | React Router | Established ecosystem, safer long-term bet |

**Analysis:**
- Split decision (3 React Router, 2 TanStack Router)
- React Router: maturity, community
- TanStack Router: modern features, types

**This split indicates:**
1. Both are viable
2. Choice depends on priority (stability vs. modern features)
3. No "wrong" answer, trade-offs exist
4. Team should discuss priorities

**Decision Process:**
1. Present findings to team
2. Discuss: Do we value maturity or modern features more?
3. Consider: Can we afford learning curve of TanStack Router?
4. Decide based on team priorities

**When Consensus IS Clear:**

If 4-5 runs recommended React Router:
- High confidence in choice
- Proceed with React Router
- Document reasoning for future reference

**Practical Takeaway**: Self-consistency isn't about always getting unanimous agreement—it's about understanding the reasoning landscape. When there's consensus, you have confidence. When there's disagreement, you've identified that multiple valid approaches exist and the choice depends on priorities. Use it for decisions with significant impact where you want to be thorough. Don't use it for every small decision—that's overkill. Think of it as your "second opinion" technique for important choices. It's especially valuable when you're new to a technology or making architectural decisions that are hard to reverse.
